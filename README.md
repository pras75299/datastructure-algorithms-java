# Java Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to solving Data Structures and Algorithms problems using Java. The focus is on practical implementation and understanding of key concepts. Each problem is solved in a separate Java file, with the problem statement documented as a comment at the beginning of each file.

## Structure

- **`src`**: Contains all Java source files, organized by problem.
  - Each Java file is named to reflect the problem it solves.
  - The problem statement and a brief explanation are included as comments at the top of each file.

## How to Use This Repository

- **Navigating the Repository**: Browse the `src` directory to find the Java file corresponding to the problem you're interested in.
- **Running a File**: Use your preferred Java environment to run each file. Each file is a standalone example of a specific DSA problem.
- **Revision and Practice**: The clear naming and isolated files make it easy to find and review specific problems.

## Contributing

While this is a personal project primarily for my own learning and revision, contributions or suggestions are welcome. Please adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Naming Convention**: Keep the file names descriptive and consistent with the existing structure.
- **Comments and Documentation**: Ensure that the problem statement and your approach are well-documented in comments.
- **Code Quality**: Write readable and efficient code, following standard Java coding conventions.
